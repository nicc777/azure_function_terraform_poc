# Deploying Azure Functions using Terraform

> **note**
> This project was cloned from https://github.com/godatadriven/azure_function_terraform after I read [an article](https://godatadriven.com/blog/deploying-an-azure-function-with-terraform/) by [Niels Zeilemaker](https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker). I wanted to experiment myself, and hence cloned the original repository with the idea to adapt it to my own needs.

> **warning**
> This is NOT production code. I use it for educational purposes to explore features in MS Azure. Use at your own risk.
